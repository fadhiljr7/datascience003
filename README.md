## Project Description
This project focuses on analyzing electric vehicles (EVs) in Washington as a reference for implementing an EV policy in the National Capital Region (NMC), which will limit the use of non-electric vehicles. In this project, we analyze various aspects of EV distribution by location, brand, model, range, and electric utility provider. The results of this analysis are presented in the form of visualizations, statistics, and insights that are relevant for decision-making regarding infrastructure and policies in the National Capital Region.

## File Structure
- Notebook.ipynb: Contains a Jupyter notebook that covers the entire process of analyzing EV data, including data cleaning, visualization creation, and statistical calculations. The notebook also contains insights gained from each visualization.
- archive.zip: The raw dataset used for the analysis of EVs in Washington. This dataset contains information about vehicles by model, make, range, electricity provider, and geographic location.
- Insight and Story of Data.pdf: A PowerPoint presentation that summarizes key insights from the analysis, including graphs and short narratives to help convey the results in a more visual way.

## Usage Guide
- Cloning Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine with the command: `git clone https://github.com/fadhiljr7/datascience003.git`
- Install dependencies: Ensure you have Python and Jupyter installed. You can install the required libraries by running: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Open Notebook: Open notebook.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab to see the entire analysis process and visualization results.
- View Insights: Use the insight.pptx file to get a visual summary of the analysis and key insights.
- Data: The data.csv file can be used to perform further analysis or verify results with raw data.

## Technologies Used
- Python: For data analysis and visualization, using libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- Jupyter Notebook: For documentation and interactive execution of analysis steps.
- PowerPoint: For presenting insights in an easy-to-understand presentation.

## Conclusion
This project provides an in-depth look at the distribution and adoption of electric vehicles in Washington, and its relevance for implementation in the capital city. Insights from this analysis can be used to support electric vehicle policy and infrastructure development that supports widespread EV adoption in the capital city.
